There are a few steps and skills required to get involved in building the knowledge base.

#### Things you will need:
- A GitHub account.
- Git installed and configured on your machine (if you're not sure how to do this, try [this guide](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop)).
- At least a basic understanding of [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) [syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
- Something you want to write about.
