## What is a CTF?

A CTF _(Capture the Flag)_ event is a type of hacking competition that challenges technical knowledge and outside of the box thinking. There are two main types of CTF challenge: **jeopardy** and **attack / defend**.

Jeopardy CTFs are the most common style and are probably the best place to start out. Challenges are grouped by category, with points being assigned to each challenge according to difficulty.

The idea is to collect tokens _(flags)_ as proof of having solved various tasks. CTFs are targeted at a range of skill levels, many of the popular ones are designed for high-school students.
